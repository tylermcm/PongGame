# Overview

With this piece of software, I am seeking to expand my knowledge of various languages, as well and sharpening my problem solving skills in different environments.

The piece of sofware that I wrote in Java was my rendition of the classic Pong game that came out in the early 1970s.

I have always been fascinated with this game as it was one of the first games ever made, 
and it has been something I have always wanted to create on my own.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write this program.

Java was employed in the creation of this program, and the standard set of libraries, in addition to the Swing library, was used.

# Future Work

- Work on the computer paddle to make it easier to beat
- Give the game difficulty levels to change the speed of the ball or paddles
- Make the game physics more natural so the ball bounces in realitic directions.
